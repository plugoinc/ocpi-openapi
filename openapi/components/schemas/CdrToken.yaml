      Unique ID by which this Token can be identified.
      This is the field used by the CPO’s system (RFID reader on the Charge Point) to identify this token.
      Currently, in most cases: type=RFID, this is the RFID hidden ID as read by the RFID reader, but that is not a requirement.
      If this is a type=APP_USER Token, it will be a unique, by the eMSP, generated ID.
