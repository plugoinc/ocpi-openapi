  country_code:
    type: string
    description: ISO-3166 alpha-2 country code of the MSP that 'owns' this Token.
  party_id:
    type: string
    description: ID of the eMSP that 'owns' this Token (following the ISO-15118 standard).
  uid:
    type: string
    description: |
     > Unique ID by which this Token, combined with the Token type, can be identified. This is the field used by CPO system (RFID reader on the Charge Point) to identify this token.
     Currently, in most cases: type=RFID, this is the RFID hidden ID as read by the RFID reader, but that is not a requirement.
     If this is a APP_USER or AD_HOC_USER Token, it will be a uniquely, by the eMSP, generated ID.
     This field is named uid instead of id to prevent confusion with: contract_id.
  type:
    description: TokenType enum
    type: string
    enum:
      - AD_HOC_USER
      - APP_USER
      - OTHER
      - RFID
  contract_id:
    type: string
    description: |
      > Uniquely identifies the EV Driver contract token within the eMSP’s platform (and suboperator platforms). Recommended to follow the specification for eMA ID from "eMI3 standard version V1.0" (http://emi3group.com/documents-links/) "Part 2: business objects."
  visual_number:
    type: string
    description: Visual readable number/identification as printed on the Token (RFID card), might be equal to the contract_id.
  issuer:
    type: string
    description: Issuing company, most of the times the name of the company printed on the token (RFID card), not necessarily the eMSP.
  group_id:
    type: string
    description: This ID groups a couple of tokens. This can be used to make two or more tokens work as one, so that a session can be started with one token and stopped with another, handy when a card and key-fob are given to the EV-driver. Beware that OCPP 1.5/1.6 only support group_ids (it is called parentId in OCPP 1.5/1.6) with a maximum length of 20.
